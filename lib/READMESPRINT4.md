# Project Title (Update)

RC controller mobile app.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Get map displaying in background.
2. Get location on map displaying.
3. Get homescreen more presentable.
4. get new theme for Joysticks.
5. remove top teal bar.
6. set connection button to overlay the map.
7. make all buttons be transparent so you can see map clearly.
