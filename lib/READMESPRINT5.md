# Project Title (Update)

This Final Sprint I wanted to do a choose your own path, and I choose to make a bluetooth server on a raspberry pi that I can discover and connect to.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Get environment for Raspberry pi set up.
2. Add python into raspberry pi.
3. Add python code to make raspberry pi a discoverable bluetooth device.

Instructions for using the software:

1. log into raspberry pi and run program.
2. Check on phone or any bluetooth device and check for available connections.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python
* pydbus
* bluez_peripheral

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Dbus](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/)
* [bluez_peripheral](https://bluez-peripheral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] The purpose of this sprint was the get the bluetooth server on a raspberry pi so a future improvement is to get camera data to transfer
* [ ] Take inputs and interpret them into joystick commands, that control motors.
