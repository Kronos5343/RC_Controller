# Project Title (Networking)

This Sprint my goal is to get the bluetooth working so I am able to at least connect to 
another device and send the joystick data over Bluetooth.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Implement libraries.
2. Create code on arduino nano 33 BLE to receive and send information on Bluetooth.
3. Create code on Android studio to send joystick values and receive a test code.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Use joysticks which should send joystick data to arduino.
2. Arduino should return some test code to replace what would be video feed. 
   (camera hasn't come in yet).

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* flutter_blue_plus v2.0.0
* ArduinoBLE library

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* I used chatgpt to give me a list of all the commands in the bluetooth library

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* I need to make a way that the bluetooth devices when searching can be filtered.
